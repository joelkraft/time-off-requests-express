# Time Off Request App

This is a simplified version of a time-off request app I built to increase the efficiency, dependability and ease around asking and being approved for time off at my job.  

As you can see, it's an [Expressjs] REST service (with [Mongo]) connected to a hand-coded client (using [bootstrap], [jquery], [momentjs] and a [datetimepicker]).  For the sake of ease and simplicity I've side-stepped authentication in this version.  

##Please play with it [here].

You can sign in as an employee, request time off, then switch over to the supervisor interface to approve or deny it.
