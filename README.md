# Time Off Request App

This is a simple app to demonstrate my ability to write app and form logic.  As you can see, it's an [Expressjs] REST service (with [Mongo]) connected to a hand-coded client (using [bootstrap], [jquery], [momentjs] and a [datetimepicker]).  For the sake of ease and simplicity I've side-stepped authentication in this version.  

Please play with it [here]
